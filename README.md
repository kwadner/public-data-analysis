# public-data-analysis
A side-project to analyze public datasets (work in progress)

## Disclaimer
This is mostly a personal project because of an interest in data, particularly public data-sets that can have useful information. It is also a "playground" to experiment with. Due to that, optimal implementations may not always be used and some functionality may seem pointless.

*To be ubundently clear*, there are often better ways to analyze data vs what is presented here.
